My solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. The Wakatime badge shows my entire time spent on this repository. I only started using Wakatime recently, so the time spent on the 2015 (and many of the 2022) challenges is not included.

# Languages

My goal is to solve each challenge using multiple languages to provide the most exposure. The current languages I have solves with:

| **Language** | **Solves** |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| ASM          | 2          |
| Bash         | 2          |
| C            | 2          |
| Python       | 2          |

# Challenge Calendars

These calendars indicate solves in _at least one_ language.

# Languages

My goal is to solve each challenge using multiple languages to provide the most exposure. 2023 is my first year going for speed, so I've been using Python for the initial solution and then solving it in other languages later.

I have a significant number of solutions in C and Python and am starting to draft solutions in x64 Assembly. I might add some other languages later.
