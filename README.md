My solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. The Wakatime badge shows my entire time spent on this repository. I only started using Wakatime recently, so the time spent on the 2015 (and many of the 2022) challenges is not included.

# Languages

My goal is to solve each challenge using multiple languages to provide the most exposure. The current languages I have solves with:

| **Language** | **Solves** |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| ASM          | 5          |
| Bash         | 2          |
| C            | 28         |
| Python       | 97         |

> _This table is automatically updated using the [aoc-readme](./utils/aoc-readme) script. It only uses the number of existing files to guess-timate this value, so it may be off if unfinished challenges were pushed accidentally._

# Challenge Calendars

These calendars indicate solves in _at least one_ language.
